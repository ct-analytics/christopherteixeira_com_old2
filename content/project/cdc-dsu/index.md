As the project lead, I managed a small team of folks with varied disciplines and specialities to help staff at CDC upskill in data science competencies. This includes being fiscally responsible and the technical expert overseeing all deliverables sent to CDC. The project involved three major tasks that I oversaw:

1. Identify Data Science competencies and develop a strategy for increasing the CDC staff's skills in those competencies. 
2. Develop a recruitment strategy for bringing on fellows with a background in data science.
3. Provide advice on the data science capstone projects for a number of teams.
