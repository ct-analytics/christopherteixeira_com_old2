Worked directly with a client to design data sources that allow for real time modeling and scoring. Led a team of statisticians to consolidate knowledge and design best practices in advanced modeling techniques for near real time model building. 

Designed a methodology to detect and predict client behavior patterns. Results of this methodology are intended to influence real time marketing decisions to improve response rates.
