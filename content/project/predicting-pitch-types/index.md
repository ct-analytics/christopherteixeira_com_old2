TruMedia Networks sponsored their 2nd Baseball Analytics Hackathon to bring together some of sport's brightest developers and analysts to see what projects and analysis they can create. Providing pitch data over the previous three years, I took the opportunity to explore the ability to predict the next pitch type.
