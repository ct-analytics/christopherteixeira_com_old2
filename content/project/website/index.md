Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit my area, I feel like a single page resume is quickly becoming an obsolete way of representing your experience and interests. My own resume becomes incredibly challenging to keep to just 2 pages even after a decade of working. There are plenty of options out there, from LinkedIn or Indeed profiles to custom websites like [about.me](https://about.me/), [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [wix](https://www.wix.com/), or any number of other alternatives. However, I found these we're completely satisfying for some of the ideas I wanted to post about and demonstrate my capabilities.

Like many other R enthusiasts, I track the various articles and packages that get discusssed on [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and in particular, RStudio. I can't remember how long ago it was when I first discovered Blogdown, but seeing how simple it looked encouraged me to create this website. Reading through the multiple posts and tutorials made it seem like this would be the easiest path for me to not just host my resume, but expand on some of my project experience. 

While developing this website in markdown, it quickly allowed me to improve my knowledge in Amazon Web Services and that various features there. Linked to this project are some of the tips and tricks I picked up from others posting on this topic and ultimately worked for me in publishing this site.
