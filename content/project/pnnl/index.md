Using AnyLogic to build a combined Discrete Event / Agent Based model to determine the effects of introducing delays to a seaport's operations. Build reports given the results of a sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo run version of the model. Compiled an applet version of the model and combined with an HTML interface to supply to the customer.
