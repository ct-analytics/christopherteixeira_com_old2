As an avid baseball fan, each game I watch usually includes a comment like "Player A is just like Player B". This has inspired me to look into a mathematical way to discover which players are similar to each other. This project utilizes a few different techniques, data sources, and ultimately a little judgement on how to fine tune the algorithm.
