Probabilistic Campaign Manifest Analysis Tool (PCMAT) was an excel based tool that would take in a manifest for a lunar campaign and run a simulation to evaluate various metrics about the campaign. I updated and expanded the capabilities of the this tool to track new metrics and increase the number of Bernoulli trials run within the course of a campaign. In addition, I improved the efficiency of the model through VBA and advanced EXCEL worksheet formulas.

Our team's effort on this work was acknowledged in the "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf">SEEKING A HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT PROGRAM WORTHY OF A GREAT NATION</a>" report to Congress.
